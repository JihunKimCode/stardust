# Path Finding Simulation
A* Path Finding Simulation using Pygame in Python.
* `a_star.py` only shows the optimal path to reach starting point to destination.
* `a_star_trial_error.py` shows how algorithm finds the optimal path.

## Controls
* The first cell you click is marked in blue and indicates starting point.
* The second cell you click is marked in red and indicates destination.
* After deciding starting point and destination, you click cells to build obstacles which indicates black. Click again to remove obstacle. You can drag to build multiple obstacles.
* Press `r` to clear everything
* Press `spacebar` to start pathfinding

## Colors
* Black: Obstacles
* Blue: Starting point
* Red: Destination
* Green: Optimal Path
* Yellow: Node being explored
* Green: Node being added to open list
